# Probzelus

This directory contains the inference library and a wrapper for the Zelus compiler linked with the inference library.

You can locally build the project with (you need to install `zelus-owl` first):

```
make
```

This will generate an executable `probzeluc.exe` that can be used to compile probzelus programs.
